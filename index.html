    <h2>I'm a visual journalist, designer, and leader helping newsrooms tell smarter, more human stories through compelling design.</h2>
<br>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>I specialize in ambitious visual journalism including investigations, immersive explainers, and data-driven storytelling that demand both craft and collaboration. From concept to execution, I shape the creative vision, assess the project scope, and align teams around realistic timelines. When complexity or stakes require it, I contribute hands-on design work. The result: award-winning projects that set standards for the industry.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>Long-form, exclusive and investigative storytelling, data-driven visuals, immersive explainers. Elevated through craft, planning and deep collaboration. I’ve worked on and overseen some of The Post’s most ambitious visual journalism—projects that regularly earned industry recognition for design excellence and innovation. Early in the process, I shape ideas, assess scope, and align creative vision with realistic timelines and resources. When the stakes or complexity call for it, I step in directly to make hands-on contributions.</p>

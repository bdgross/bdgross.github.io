                  <p>I’m a visual journalist, design and editor. I lead visual teams that shape complex reporting into clear, compelling stories. For more than 20 years, I’ve worked at the intersection of design and journalism, helping newsrooms tell smarter, more human stories at </p>
                    <p><strong>What I do:</strong> I build systems that support speed, quality and innovation. I develop high-perfoming talent — designers, art directors, illustrators and developers — and grow future leaders. I help organizations define what great visual journalism looks like at scale through long-term vision.</p>
                   <p><strong>How I think:</strong> The reader always comes first. Storytelling is the goal. Every type choice, interaction, and illustration carries meaning and responsibility. Clarity is impact. Trust is everything. The best work happens when designers, reporters, and editors build together, not in silos.</p>

<h2>Selected works and experience</h2>
<p>Since I came to The Post as a senior designer and editor in 2014, I’ve gotten a chance to be a part of dozens of The Post’s most exciting and innovative projects including Pulitzer Prize winning stories, months-long investigations and quick turnaround projects. My role varies: sometimes I’m working with the editors and designers to shape the story, other times refining the UX or presentation for the smallest screens. My job is to make sure that we overcome any challenges, and that the stories publish on time across all platforms.</p>

<h2>Some projects I designed</h2>
<p>When I started at The Post, the design team was print focused. I helped lead the team through a digital transition. As an art director, designer and collaborater with reporters, other editors and visual colleagues, I brainstormed presentations that emphasized the unique parts of each story. After four years, I became the deputy department head.</p>

<h2>Some publication design</h2>
<p>My career started as a print designer both at The Post and previous newspapers such as The Boston Globe. While I focus most of my time on digital presentation first now, print design was where I learned the importance of white space, typography and hierachy. Here’s some of the ones that hold up.</p>

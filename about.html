        <h3>Expertise</h3>
        <p><strong>What I do:</strong> I build systems that support speed, quality and innovation. I develop high-perfoming talent — designers, art directors, illustrators and developers — and grow future leaders. I help organizations define what great visual journalism looks like at scale through long-term vision.</p>
        <p><strong>How I think:</strong> The reader always comes first. Storytelling is the goal. Every type choice, interaction, and illustration carries meaning and responsibility. Clarity is impact. Trust is everything. The best work happens when designers, reporters, and editors build together, not in silos.</p>
     <p><strong>What I'm focused on now: </strong>Helping media organizations evolve how they tell stories visually across platforms and reach audiences through narrative design and repeatable formats.</p>

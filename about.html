        <h2>I'm Brian Gross, a visual journalism leader who builds award-winning teams and creates storytelling that resonates. For 25+ years, I've worked at the intersection of design and journalism, most recently at The Washington Post, where I helped shape some of the newsroom's most ambitious and recognized work.</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/brian-gross/">Washington Post design team</a> since 2010, previously Boston Globe sports designer.</p>
        <p>Organized and ran <a href="https://snd.org/">Society for News Design</a> digital competition from 2019-2024.</p>
        <p>Graduate of journalism school at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. Became a baseball fan growing up just outside St. Louis, and my dream job since the 8th grade was to be a sports writer. </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>What I do:</strong> I specialize in transforming complex reporting into clear, compelling visual experiences. Whether leading teams on enterprise investigations or stepping in to design hands-on, I focus on craft, collaboration, and strategic thinking that aligns creative ambition with real-world constraints. </p>
        <p><strong>My approach:</strong> Great visual journalism requires more than good design—it needs early collaboration, smart scoping, and a deep understanding of what makes stories connect with audiences. I work across departments to shape concepts, guide creative direction, and ensure projects are both beautiful and achievable.</p>
        <p><strong>Recognition:</strong> My work has contributed to two Pulitzer Prizes and earned numerous industry honors, including Best in Show recognition from the Society for News Design. But the real measure is the impact: stories that inform, move, and stick with readers</p>
        <p><strong>What I'm looking for: </strong> Media or communications jobs, and open to consulting, freelancing or teaching.</p>

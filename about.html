        <h3>Expertise</h3>
        <p>Over the past decade at The Washington Post, I’ve helped shape how one of the world’s most influential newsrooms approaches design across platforms—supporting designers, editors, and managers while elevating storytelling through thoughtful presentation, collaboration, and execution. My role has spanned daily news, print, interactives, and long-term enterprise, often during periods of rapid change and uncertainty.</p>
        <p><strong>What I do:</strong> A core part of my leadership is building environments where strong visual journalism and innovation can happen consistently. That means setting clear expectations, creating durable workflows and documentation, and protecting space for designers to do ambitious work without burning out. My goal as an editor is to make the work — and the process — feel stronger and more intentional than it was before. I’ve spent much of my career managing managers, mentoring emerging leaders, and helping teams adapt through mergers, buyouts, and evolving newsroom priorities. I provide a calm, reliable presence as someone who fills gaps, follows through, and helps teams move forward when things get complicated. I see leadership not as having all the answers, but as listening carefully, making thoughtful decisions, and positioning people to succeed. </p>
        <p><strong>How I think:</strong> I’m particularly motivated by audience-centered design.The reader always comes first. Storytelling is the goal. Every type choice, interaction, and illustration carries meaning and responsibility. Clarity is impact. Trust is everything. The best work happens when designers, reporters, and editors build together, not in silos. In recent years, I’ve pushed for more data-informed critique, UX analysis, and shared learning — using analytics not as a scoreboard, but as a tool to improve clarity, usability, and impact.</p>
        <p><strong>What I'm focused on now: </strong>Helping media organizations evolve how they tell stories visually across platforms and reach audiences through narrative design and repeatable formats.</p>

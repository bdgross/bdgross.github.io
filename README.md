HERO / INTRO

Brian Gross
Visual Journalism • Design Leadership • Story Systems

I lead visual teams that turn complex reporting into clear, compelling, human stories. My work sits at the intersection of editorial judgment, design systems, and newsroom innovation—shaping how millions of people experience the news.

For more than two decades, I’ve built and led multidisciplinary teams across design, graphics, product, and engineering to elevate journalism through storytelling, craft, and clarity.

WHAT I DO

Design Leader
I build and guide high-performing visual teams—designers, developers, illustrators, and editors—focused on impact, rigor, and innovation.

Visual Journalist
I shape stories visually from concept to execution, collaborating with reporters and editors to find the strongest narrative form.

Editor & Strategist
I help organizations define what great visual journalism looks like at scale—through standards, workflows, and long-term vision.

PHILOSOPHY

Great visual journalism isn’t decoration—it’s reporting.

Designers are editors. Every type choice, interaction, and illustration carries meaning and responsibility. The goal is not spectacle, but understanding. Not novelty, but impact. Not just attention—but trust.

I believe the strongest work comes from deep collaboration, clear editorial purpose, and a relentless focus on the reader.

EXPERIENCE (FORMATTED LIKE CALLOUT SECTIONS)

Leadership at Scale
Built and led cross-functional teams spanning editorial design, product design, graphics, illustration, and engineering—delivering daily news, enterprise projects, and long-form storytelling.

Narrative-Driven Design
Specialized in immersive storytelling, data visualization, and explanatory design that clarifies complex topics without flattening nuance.

Systems + Craft
Balanced high-level strategy with hands-on execution—developing design systems, accessibility standards, and production workflows that support both speed and excellence.

Talent Development
Hired, mentored, and promoted designers and editors into leadership roles—building sustainable teams, not just projects.

SELECTED WORK (SECTION INTRO COPY)

A selection of projects across breaking news, enterprise investigations, data-driven storytelling, and visual explainers—spanning print, web, video, and interactive experiences.

Each project reflects close collaboration between reporters, designers, developers, and editors—where storytelling decisions are made together, not in silos.

(Case studies would live here.)

IMPACT & RECOGNITION (OPTIONAL SECTION)

Work I’ve led or contributed to has shaped how large audiences engage with major stories—earning industry recognition for innovation, storytelling, and design excellence.

More importantly, the work has helped readers understand elections, crises, culture, science, and history with greater clarity and trust.

ABOUT (PERSONAL, BUT EDITORIAL)

I’m a visual journalist, design leader, and lifelong student of storytelling.

Outside of work, I’m a lifelong baseball stats and card nerd (Cardinals), a history and architecture obsessive, a Star Wars and Lego enthusiast, and a dad. I care deeply about craft, mentorship, and building things that last.

NOW / AVAILABILITY

Currently focused on helping newsrooms and media organizations evolve how they tell stories visually—through leadership, systems thinking, and editorial design that puts the audience first.
